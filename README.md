# Terraform
Terraform file that provisions resources using AWS services including Amazon EC2, Amazon S3, Amazon IAM, Amazon VPC, Amazon RDS, and Amazon ECS:


In this example,  included the resource blocks for Amazon EC2 (aws_instance), Amazon S3 (aws_s3_bucket), Amazon IAM (aws_iam_user), Amazon VPC (aws_vpc and aws_subnet), Amazon RDS (aws_rds_instance and aws_db_subnet_group), and Amazon ECS (aws_ecs_cluster, aws_ecs_task_definition, and aws_iam_role).

Remember to customize the configuration according to your specific requirements, such as the desired region, AMI ID, instance type, bucket name, IAM user name, SSH key name, RDS settings, ECS container definition, and any other settings you need for your infrastructure.

Once you have updated the configuration, follow the same steps as mentioned before to initialize, plan, and apply the Terraform configuration.
